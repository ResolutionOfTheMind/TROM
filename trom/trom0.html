<P>I&#8217;d like to acknowledge my debt of thanks to the world&#8217;s great philosophers, artists, and men of compassion,
past and present, who reminded me of man&#8217;s better qualities. Particularly to George Boole, the man who took logic
out of the esoteric and brought it into the realm of a mathematical calculus understandable by a second year algebra
student.</P>
<P>I would like to acknowledge my special debt of thanks to L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Dianetics and Scientology,
the man who took psychology out of the brain and gave it back to the people. I was privileged to work with Dr.
Hubbard during the formative years of his subjects, and he alone kindled the spark within me the spark which said
that sense could be made out of life, and that something could be done about it.</P>

<P>If all games are fun, and no game is reasonable, and if resolving the mind is a reasonable activity, then it
is not a game, but that does not prevent it from being fun.</P>
<P>D.H.S.</P>

<P>It is not necessary to believe the theory before the practical exercises will work for you; just hold it as
a possibility, that is all. Even the fact that the practical works doesn&#8217;t make the theory right, for there&#8217;s a
number of possible theories from which the practical could be derived. However, until such time as practical derived
from theory is found not to work it is safe to regard the theory as useful. No more can be said of any theory.
Also, its&#8217; rightness or wrongness depends on how well it explains natural law, not what people think about it.</P>
<P>I know of no applications where this theory falls short of explaining observed phenomena. However, I&#8217;ll be the
first to applaud any being who can explain all the facts with a simpler theory from which even more workable practical
exercises can be derived. (Occam was an old friend of mine.)</P>
