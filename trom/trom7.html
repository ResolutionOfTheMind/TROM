<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This universe only consists of life and purposes. Some of the purposes are perceive as more solid than others.
The basic purposes from which all others stem are the four legs of the &#8216;To know&#8217; goals package. All other (junior)
purposes are methods of achieving one or other of the basic purposes, and are therefore within the basic &#8216;To know&#8217;
goals package. If you can clearly see how a junior purpose is within one or other of the basic purposes, then it
will erase at Level 5a and need no further address in therapy. However, due to the vicissitudes of games play,
some junior purposes come to be regarded as independent of the basic purposes, and they will have to be addressed
at Level 5b.</P>
<P>The purpose can either be formulated directly into a junior goals package and erased or collapsed in therapy,
or, if unerasable, will be found to reside in the negative leg of some other erasable junior goals package. Eg.
The goal &#8216;To Display&#8217; can be formulated into an erasable goals package. E.g. The goal &#8216;To Hide&#8217; cannot be formulated
into an erasable goals package, but it resides within the goal To not Display, so can be erased by erasing or collapsing
the &#8216;To Display&#8217; goals package at Level 5b. An object only consists of one or more purposes (functions), and can
be erased from the mind by erasing these purposes. If the purpose or purposes of an object are clearly seen as
within one or other purposes of the basic &#8216;To know&#8217; goals package, then this object will erase from the mind at
Level 5a without any need for further address in therapy. However, if the object is believed to consist of purposes
independent of the basic purposes, these purposes will have to be addressed at Level 5b as indicated above. Finally,
the object - if still not erased - can be erased by making it the subject matter of the &#8216;To Know&#8217; goals package
at Level 5c.</P>
<P>E.g. A girl has completed Levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 of therapy, and has nulled the basic package as far as possible
at Level 5a. She obviously has purposes which she considers to be independent of the basic purposes (Otherwise
her whole mind would have erased at Level 5a.) and she recalls that she&#8217;s always felt uneasy about wearing a dress,
and decides to erase the class of &#8216;Dresses&#8217; from her mind. (N.B. The choice of material to be run at Level 5b and
5c is always made on the basis of interest.) She decides that a dress has two purposes:</P>

			and</TD>

		<TD WIDTH="5%" VALIGN="TOP">2)</TD>
		<TD WIDTH="95%" VALIGN="TOP">A modesty function of hiding her body.</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>
<P>Addressing each of these in turn she first formulates the &#8216;To Display&#8217; goals package which she discovers to
be erasable. The concealing function of the dress is &#8216;To Hide&#8217; which she discovers cannot be formulated into an
erasable goals package, but spots that its within the &#8216;To not Display&#8217; leg of the &#8216;To Display&#8217; goals package. She
addresses the &#8216;To Display&#8217; package at Level 5b, and it collapses after a few minutes when she realizes that &#8216;To
Display&#8217; is a method of being known, and is therefore within the &#8216;To be Known&#8217; leg of the basic package. She now
re - nulls the basic &#8216;To Know&#8217; package at Level 5a according to the rule.</P>
<P>The position now, she realizes, is that the class of Dresses, although reduced, has not yet erased from her
mind, so she hunts around for some other function of a dress. She soon spots that a dress has a sexual function
when displaying her femininity, so she addresses the &#8216;To Sex&#8217; goals package at Level 5b. During the erasure of
this package a childhood sexual incident involving her dress pops into view and explains her lifelong unease with
wearing a dress. When the &#8216;To Sex&#8217; package erases she returns to and re-nulls the &#8216;To Know&#8217; package at Level 5a.
She then makes &#8216;A Dress&#8217; the subject matter of the &#8216;To Know&#8217; goals package at Level 5c, only to discover that its
already erased during the re-nulling of Level 5a. She has now erased the class of &#8216;Dresses&#8217; from her mind, and
is ready to find another object or junior goals package for erasure. One day, when routinely re-nulling Level 5a
after erasing an object or junior goals package from her mind, to her great joy the basic &#8216;To Know&#8217; goals package
will itself go on through to erasure. She will then have achieved a full resolution of mind - and know it.</P>
