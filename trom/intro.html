<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="about"></A><U>About Dennis Stephens</U></P>
<P>He first contacted Dianetics in England in July 1950, and was a Dianetic secretary and Co-auditor for two years
from September 1950 to 1952.&nbsp; In September 1952 he took professional training under LRH and was awarted HPA
and HGA certificates.&nbsp; He was HASI London's first Director of Processing in November 1952.&nbsp; He took his
Bachelor Degree in 1953 and his Doctorate in 1954.&nbsp; From 1954 to 1956 he was Director of Training and Examiner
Worldwide.&nbsp; In 1954 he married Anne Walker, then Director of Processing HASI London.</P>
<P>In 1957 Dennis and Anne migrated to Australia, where for many years Dennis was an executive in HASI Sydney.&nbsp;
He attended the SHSBC in 1962, and in 1963 was Association Secretary and HCO Secretary HASI Sydney.&nbsp; He left
the Org in 1965, and was a field auditor for many years in Sydney with Anne.&nbsp; He and Anne retired to Redland
Bay, Queensland.</P>
<P>He had a keen interest in Jazz and at his funeral in January 1993 Anne requested that &quot;When the Saints
go marching In&quot; be played.<BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="created"></A><U>How TROM was created:</U></P>
<P>The resolution of Mankind's social problems untimately depends on a solution to problems of the human mind.&nbsp;
But this requires both a technology and its application.</P>
<P>It would be useless if a highly-skilled, highly-trained practitioner was also needed, because the technology
would be available only to the affluent - leaving the majority of humanity unchanged.</P>
<P>Thus, the technology of the mind must be usable on either a co-audit basis (people helping each other free themselves
of charge/stress) or on a do-it-yourself basis.&nbsp; In 1950 when L.Ron Hubbard wrote &quot;Dianetics, the Modern
Science of Mental Health&quot;, he offered a co-audit route.&nbsp; Two factors prevented this route from being
achieved: preclears varied in difficulty of case; and auditors varied in skill.&nbsp; Ron had no solution to the
problem, nor did I, and the only route we could go down was that of professional training.</P>
<P>(Good natural auditors armed with Book One, facing an easily-running preclear, did achieve incredible results,
but poor auditors confronting difficult cases got absolutely nowhere).</P>
<P>Professional training was the optimum way to go at the time.&nbsp; In 1953 and 1954, we HASI London auditors
used to burn the midnight oil talking about clearing the planet on a co-audit basis, but it seemed a hopeless dream.&nbsp;
I used to raise the idea of a do-it-yourself technology, but the mechanics of Dianetics and of the mind seemed
to rule that out.</P>
<P>There are such things as engrams (mental image pictures of pain and unconsciousness of past events), which can
be restimulated, cutting the analytical mind out of circuit, producing abberated behaviour.&nbsp; A preclear (a
person aspiring to the state of 'clear'), in the presence of these highly charged incidents, will experience a
shut-down of his analytical mind.&nbsp; He could not then handle the incidents himself, therefore must have a separate
therapist - as a guide.&nbsp; That made a lot of sense in the early Fifties.</P>
<P>Yet the simple truth remained.&nbsp; If we were to get a cleared planet, it would be achieved only by either
co-auditing or on a do-it-yourself basis.&nbsp; We professionals knew it, and anyone who thinks about it, plainly
knows it.&nbsp; As well - it can be done on a pay basis.</P>
<P>Years later, I resurrected the problem on a very quiet, peaceful summer's evening.&nbsp; I was on a Sydney Harbour
ferry going from downtown Sydney to the suburb where I lived, and my mind was particularly clear that evening in
the beautiful surroundings.&nbsp; Suddenly, I thought: &quot;What exactly are the factors involved here?&quot;<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="question"></A><U>Questioning everything</U></P>
<P>This meant questioning Ron's analysis of the problem.&nbsp; He had concluded that a separate therapist was vital,
and the evidence had seemed to say that he was right. I had to question this.&nbsp; When I got home, I went to
my study, took out a sheet of paper and wrote down exactly what I thought was the function of an auditor in session.</P>
<P>I wrote down on another sheet of paper exactly what the preclear (client) does and what is his function in the
session.&nbsp; Then I said to myself:&nbsp; Well, if it is going to be a do-it-yourself therapy, the preclear is
going to have to run both the auditor's role and the preclear's role simultaneously - but how can this be done
when the person is dealing with his/her reactive bank, which is going to cut out the analytical mind?</P>
<P>I put that to one side with a question mark, and asked: What is restimulation?</P>
<P>It is an incident from the past moving into the present, affecting the analytical mind even to the point of
cutting out that mind completely.</P>
<P>Then I recalled what I regard as one of Ron's great discoveries: &quot;if you can get the preclear to do consciously
that which his mind does automatically, he will regain control of that function of his psyche.&quot;</P>
<P>So maybe the problem would crack if the person, on a do-it-yourself basis, were to take things out of his past
and bring them into the present and put them back out into the past again, and bring them into the present......to
learn how to do consciously, what his reactive mind does automatically, to start to take over the automaticity.</P>
<P>Then and there, I knew I'd cracked it.&nbsp; That had been the missing datum.&nbsp; The analytical part of the
psyche can duplicate exactly what the reactive mind can do.</P>
<P>The analytical faculty has at it's disposal the creative faculty of the whole spiritual being, and can simulate,
create, bring about, mockup, and do exactly what the reactive part of the mind is doing.&nbsp; Evidently, the analytical
part of the mind has decided not to do this, but it can learn (or relearn) how to do so.</P>
<P>The next day, I got to work on the technique.&nbsp; It was not long before I spotted precisely what needed to
be done, and this became the first step of the do-it-yourself procedure that is now called TROM, The Resolution
of the Mind.&nbsp; I started to apply this to myself, tested it, and found that it did not need any modification.&nbsp;
It was right.&nbsp; And it did the trick!<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="taking"></A><U>Taking Over of Mind's Automaticity</U></P>
<P>I learnt to take over the automaticity of my own reactive bank.&nbsp; Finally, there was nothing the bank could
throw at me that I could not handle, for I could do consciously what it was doing.&nbsp; The bank could restimulate
engrams?&nbsp; Me too!&nbsp; It had no power over me any more.&nbsp; This was proved by the E-meter needle, which
was just sitting there idly.&nbsp; I could think anywhere all over my past.&nbsp; Nothing moved.&nbsp; I had broken
the automaticity!</P>
<P>That was the first step.&nbsp; The second step followed immediately from step one, and was a direct extension
of the abilities regained at Step One.&nbsp; These techniques are written up in TROM.</P>
<P>I ran step two absolutely flat and achieved much more case gain --- serenity, enormous mental calmness.&nbsp;
(I can become completely and utterly calm at a moment's notice).&nbsp; At this point, I abandoned the use of the
meter, because my own sense of what was happening in my mind was equal to what the E-meter could tell me.&nbsp;
I would know before the meter gave it's read, look at it, realise what the read was, spot it, and the read would
go off the meter.</P>
<P>Life is more perceptive than any mechanical device!</P>
<P>Quickly, I realised that, if I were to tell people about this technology, I had to find out if they could use
it.&nbsp; Was there a case level below which a person should not work solo?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I rapidly devised
an auditing command by which a person determines whether he/she is above or below this level, which has become
the new Level&nbsp; One.&nbsp; (The original first level became Level Two, and the old second level became Level
Three).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="stability"></A><U>Stability</U></P>
<P>In TROM, Level One finds out if the person is sufficiently mentally stable to run do-it-yourself.&nbsp; How
stable does a person have to be?&nbsp; It is not very high.&nbsp; Remember the old CCH levels? (i.e. a series of
processes in full called Communication, Control, Havingness).&nbsp; If a person needs the old CCHs to be run, then
those should be run on him by an auditor before he solos on Level Two.</P>
<P>&gt;From my experience as an auditor, from that of other auditors and by what Ron said on the subject, only
a very tiny proportion (about 5%) of humanity need running on the CCHs before doing subjective processes.&nbsp;
That doesn't say that the 95% are easy cases, and the world is full of tough cases that do not need the CCHs.</P>
<P>Interestingly, once such a CCH case has completed the CCHs, then does Level One of TROM, he will find that he
is above that level, will of course pass the Test, and can now go on to Level Two and say good-bye to the separate
therapist.</P>
<P>So 95% of the human race can quickly start straight in at Level Two, after testing and passing on Level One.</P>
<P>Well, I soon found myself sitting at the top of Level Three, wondering where to go, and the only subject that
was interesting me was that of purposes, goals, --- raw postulates.</P>
<P>In the early 1960s I had done the Saint Hill Briefing Course.&nbsp; I reviewed everything I had learnt on that,
but none of it helped.&nbsp; Back on my own again, I learned how to handle postulates in conflict --- and found
out that Ron had never learnt how to do it.&nbsp; There was a certain fundamental truth in that area that he had
not spotted.</P>
<P>My own techniques for resolving postulates in conflict ---- handle correct goals packages.&nbsp; I found what
the true goals packages look like and how to take them apart.&nbsp; You will find this, and it is in Levels Four
and Five of TROM.</P>
<P>The research on goals and so forth took me about a year to iron out and turned out to be a lot more complex
than I had thought it would be, especially Level Five.&nbsp; I understood why Ron had failed in 1960.&nbsp; His
efforts were valiant.&nbsp; He was almost doomed to fail.</P>
<P>The actual legs, the actual postulates of the true GPMs aren't in the reactive bank.&nbsp; They're in the analytical
mind.&nbsp; If you search in the bank, you will do it all wrong.</P>
<P>It is an analytical construct, so they're in the analytical mind.&nbsp; All that is in the bank is a mish-mash
of wrong opposers. The lies.&nbsp; The truth is in the analytical mind.</P>
<P>So the mistake Ron made on the subject of goals was to look into a mass of lies, in the bank, for the truth.&nbsp;
That is why the search went on forever, and why he nearly killed himself in the 1960s.<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="spot"></A><U>Spotting the Truth</U></P>
<P>It was a mistake he was almost doomed to make.&nbsp; I nearly made it, till I realised it was darned near killing
me too.&nbsp; I started off afresh and spotted where the truth was, then got Levels Four and Five.</P>
<P>Level Four is really just an introduction to Five, sort of cleaning the charge off the major goals in this lifetime.&nbsp;
A kind of lock scanning, you might say, to take off some of the surface charge before getting down to the nitty
gritty.</P>
<P>The postulates themselves are handled on Level Five.&nbsp; When I was about half way through this level, an
old Scientology chum showed me the materials of all of Ron's Upper Levels, as far as the top of OT 7 or OT 8.&nbsp;
I took a rest from my own auditing to check through every one of these levels.</P>
<P>OT 1, fine.&nbsp; OT 2, interesting but flat.&nbsp; I put myself back on the meter for this but the only needle
movement was overrun reads.&nbsp; I was trying to make a process work that was flat.&nbsp; OT 3, I couldn't make
it work, it was all flat.&nbsp; And so on, each level:&nbsp; ran it, floating needle to start with.&nbsp; If I
started to run the process the needle would tighten.&nbsp; Overrun?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Needle frees up.&nbsp; Float.&nbsp;
Trying to run a flat process&nbsp; -----&nbsp; overrun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually&nbsp; ---&nbsp; OT 7.</P>
<P>Then back from OT 1 to OT 7 again.&nbsp; All flat.&nbsp; That really shook me rigid.&nbsp; Because here I was
just half way through my own upper level tech and the best that Ron knew was flat already on my case!&nbsp; Later,
I came across levels above OT 7, and each of those was flat too.</P>
<P>The biggest difficulty a person will have with TROM is to get started, for the average person has fought themselves
to a standstill playing games with the mind and has been overwhelmed by the reactive bank. A person might let a
separate therapist tamper with it, but not do so himself. The cure for this is Levels Two and Three of TROM, done
solo.&nbsp; Is there a Level Six? No.&nbsp; Five is the works.</P>
<P>You'll love TROM.&nbsp; When you read it, you'll sit around with your friends and the urge will be to sit and
talk about TROM forever, and talk and talk and never do it!</P>
<P>So, just.....DO IT!</P>
<P>Now we can really achieve the goals Ron set in 1950, and we can clear the planet, for it can be done on a do-it-yourself
basis.&nbsp; The technology can be applied by anyone, regardless of the amount of money or income he/she has.</P>
<P>Well, that is about all on the Creation of TROM, and I wish you luck with it.</P>
