<P>Life is a spiritual quality. It has four basic abilities:-</P>

</P>
<P>These actions are accomplished by postulates. A postulate is a causative consideration.</P>
<P>That which is brought into existence, taken out of existence, known or not-known is called an effect.</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>Thus, 1 &amp; 3 and 2 &amp; 4 are complementary postulates. They enhance affinity.<BR>
Thus, 1 &amp; 4 and 2 &amp; 3 are conflicting postulates. They lower affinity.</P>
<P>Conflicting postulates are called a game. The purpose of a game is to have fun. All conflicting postulates are
essentially a game, though it may be called other things. Due to contagion with opposing postulates all games tend
to reduce the ability of the being to postulate. The power of a being is his ability to make his postulates effective.</P>
<P>A game is won when the loser becomes convinced of the opponents postulates. Thus, all games are essentially
contests in conviction, and all failure is basically postulate failure. (Those things which have been variously
called engrams, traumas, etc. will be found upon examination only to consist of postulate failure.) Postulate failure
is known as an overwhelm. Overwhelming the postulate of an opponent in a game is know as an overt act. Having one&#8217;s
own postulates overwhelmed is called a motivator.</P>
<P>The difference between win/lose and overt/motivator is a very fine one, and is determined solely by the considered
value of the game. If the game is relatively trivial, then win/lose is applied; if the game is serious ( important
) then overt/motivator is applied.</P>
<P>In that the winning of a game brings about the end of the game - and thus the loss of the game itself - winning
and losing are junior considerations to the actual playing of the game. Thus the playing of the game is senior
to the consideration of win/lose. It is a rule of all games, that intentionally lowering one&#8217;s ability in order
to be more evenly matched with the opponent leads inevitably to the state of an enforced loss of the game.</P>
<P>Thus, the paradox of all games:</P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">
	<TR>
		<TD WIDTH="5%" VALIGN="TOP">a.</TD>

		<TD WIDTH="95%" VALIGN="TOP">To invite a loss is to eventually have a loss enforced upon one.</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>
<P>Thus, eventual failure is the end result of all games.</P>
<P>This is the dwindling spiral of ability of the being in the universe. ( After the loss of a game considered
serious, the loser&#8217;s only recourse is to blame the victor for overwhelming him. Thus, blame is the assignment of
responsibility for the outcome of a game, with an implied wrongness. If the victor accepts this blame - it too
is a postulate overwhelm - he feels guilt. Thus, blame and guilt are seen as two sides of the same coin: where
one is present you will always find the other. They are a pair, and are quite inseparable. )</P>
<P>Games are played in space and need time for their completion. In the absence of games, space and time cease
to exist. Thus, conflicting postulates perpetuate space and time, while complementary postulates vanish it. A game,
to be worth playing, must contain elements considered valuable. Value is monitored by the consideration of beauty,
and is increased by scarcity. But as both the effect and the consideration of value or beauty are generated by
life, then life has a senior value to all things. ( Civilizations invariably decline when this truth is lost. )</P>
<P>Complementary postulates enhance life; conflicting postulates detract from it. Thus, games, although considered
fun, have the liability of lessening the &quot;amount&quot; of life the being possesses.</P>
<P>Games, by their very nature, can become compulsive, and result in a lessening of life - to such a degree that
the true nature of life, postulates and games themselves become unknown to the being. This state of affairs is
only resolved, in the final instance, by the application of complementary postulates. Thus complementary postulates,
when applied, have the ability to dissolve all games.</P>
<P>The four basic actions of life each have a twin postulate structure:</P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">

	</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>
<P><BR>
Thus, in each of the basic actions, each postulate complements and enhances its&#8217; twin. Thus, the postulate structure
between beings is:</P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">

	</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>
<P>The &quot;self&quot; postulate is at one&#8217;s own end of the comm line, and is called the self-determined postulate
( SD ); the &quot;other&#8217;s&quot; postulate is the one you put at the other end of the comm line, and is called the
pan-determined postulate ( PD ). Thus, when two beings, at different ends of a comm line, adopt (1) and (3) or
(2) and (4) respectively, both their self-determined and pan-determined postulates match perfectly, and understanding
occurs. However, when they adopt (1) &amp; (4) or (2) &amp; (3) respectively, there is conflict between their SD
&amp; PD postulates and understanding is correspondingly reduced.</P>
<P>It is a law of all games that overwhelming failure causes the being to compulsively adopt the pan-determined
postulate of his opponent. This is the postulate enforced upon him at his end of the comm line. A game, then, can
be regarded as a conflict of postulates wherein a being endeavors to convince his opponent of his own ( PD ) postulate,
while resisting the ( PD ) postulate arrayed against him. All games, despite their seeming complexity, can be reduced
to this basic simplicity and thus understood.</P>
<P>All games contain conviction. Conviction, by definition, is an enforcement of knowingness. Enforcement of knowingness
is called importance. Importance is the basis of all significance. Essentially, importance is a &quot;must&quot;.</P>
<P>In games of play our four basic abilities become:</P>

</TABLE>
</P>
<P>That which is considered important tends to persist and to become more solid. Solidity and persistence - need
for - are thus the basic conviction phenomena in games. Things are made more solid and more persistent to convince
others of their existence. The mechanism is entirely reversible: that which is persisting and solid is tended to
be regarded as important.</P>
<P>Any importance is relative to, and can be evaluated against, any other importance. There is no absolute importance.
Thus, what the being considers important is relative to the being and the games he is playing.</P>
<P>Thus, any field of knowledge which postulates an absolute importance is at variance with natural law. ( The
search for deeper significance into life or the mind is only the search for prior or greater importance. In that
all importance is relative to all other importance it is both a fruitless and endless search. Various past researchers
in this field have claimed to have discovered basic importances of a more or less absolute nature ( &#8216;sex&#8217;, &#8216;survival&#8217;,
etc. ) and then proceeded to develop a therapy based upon their discovery. We can now see clearly why they failed.
The &quot;button&quot; is importance. Having now found it we can stop looking for it. )</P>
<P>The amount of conviction required to convince a being of the existence of a postulate is relative to the being
and the games he is playing. A games rule is an agreement between beings denoting permissible play. However, games
rules, being postulates themselves, and being junior to the games postulates, also become subject to games play.</P>
<P>Thus, Law, Justice, etc. become themselves a games condition, and are subject to, and junior to the basic laws
of games. Thus, any games rule, once introduced, immediately becomes subject to a games condition in its&#8217; own right.
Thus, the only immutable laws are the four basic abilities of life itself. All else tends to be of a transient
nature.</P>
<P>Collecting and numbering our four basic SD postulates we get:</P>

<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">

</TABLE>
</P>
<P>The basic games are: <IMG SRC="image1.gif" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="85" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
<P>These four numbers we shall call the legs of the basic game. The oppositions are shown by the arrows.</P>
<P>In that it is not possible to play a game with an effect until it has been brought into existence, all games
with an effect start at (1); due to progressive postulate failure the being progresses round the legs of the basic
game in the following manner:</P>
<P>The being at (1) is in opposition to (4), whom he is endeavoring to convince that the effect should be known;
(4) on the other hand, is doing a &#8216;Mustn&#8217;t Know&#8217; on the effect, and his PD postulate is &#8216;Mustn&#8217;t be Known&#8217;. If
(1) fails he will adopt the PD postulate of (4), and will move from leg (1) to leg (2) regarding the effect. He
has now left the old game, and is confronted with a new opponent, (3), who is endeavoring to know the effect. Failure
in this new game will result in (2) being forced to adopt the PD postulate of (3), which is &#8216;Must be Known&#8217;. However,
he can no longer adopt this postulate regarding the effect, for it is already in failure from the earlier game,
so he now leaves (2) and adopts the valence of (3) and maintains the postulate &#8216;Must Know&#8217; regarding the effect.
He is now in opposition to his own old identity, (2), and carries the SD postulate of &#8216;Must Know&#8217;, with the PD
postulate of &#8216;Must be Known&#8217;. Further failure causes the being to adopt the PD postulate of (2), &#8216;Mustn&#8217;t Know&#8217;,
and so sink into leg (4) with an SD postulate of &#8216;Must not Know&#8217;. In this new and final game with the effect he
is opposed by (1), &#8216;Must be Known&#8217;, regarding the effect. Failure in this game will force him to adopt the postulate
&#8216;Must Know&#8217;. However, he cannot adopt this postulate regarding the effect as it is already in failure. So he goes
into the valence of (1) and henceforth operates with a substitute effect. This is forced, for an examination of
the situation will now show that all four postulates, both as SD and PD, are now in failure, so no further game
with the original effect is any longer playable.</P>
<P>This cycle is known as the Postulate Failure Cycle regarding an effect. The route around the legs is:


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><IMG SRC="image2.gif" WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="84" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The four legs constitute the four legs of the goal &#8216;To Know&#8217;. All other goals likewise have four legs, but an
examination of them will reveal that without exception they are all methods of making known, making not-known,
knowing, or not-knowing. Thus, they are junior to the goal &#8216;To Know&#8217; and we need not consider them.</P>
<P>The past of the being, then, will be found to consist of the various vicissitudes he has encountered on the
legs of the goal &#8216;To Know&#8217; regarding a succession of effects and substitute effects. If desired, this route can
be traced back through time.</P>

</P>
<P>Note: The Time Track runs from 8 to 1. You work from 1 to 8, around and around.<BR>
There is a valence shift on the Track between 1 and a new substitute effect entered at 8B.<BR>
Also a valence shift occurs between 5A and 4B.</P>

<UL>
	<P>
</UL>

<P>It is to be noted that valence shifts are always diagonally across the goals package. The valence the being
goes into is called the winning valence; the valence he comes out of is called the losing valence. Thus, legs 1
and 3 are winning valences, and legs 2 and 4 are losing valences. Shifts from legs 1 to 2, or 3 to 4, are not valence
shifts, they are merely the super-imposition of a Mustn&#8217;t postulate over an existing Must postulate, now in failure.
All valence shifts involve the adoption of a new identity, whether real or imagined.</P>
<P>The repository of these experiences on the goal &#8216;To Know&#8217; regarding a succession of effects and substitute effects
we call the mind. Basically, then, the mind is best considered as a collection of past importance. Due to their
intrinsic nature, past importances have a command power over the being in the present. However, as these various
past importances are contacted and re-evaluated to present time realities the mind will be found to become progressively
less persisting and less and less solid, and will finally vanish. Nevertheless, the being can, at any time, by
re-injecting sufficient fresh importance into any part of it, cause it to reappear in any desired solidity. Needless
to say, when this stage is reached the mind will no longer have a command power over the being, and his full abilities
will be restored. The command power of the mind over the being is only the command power of the postulates it contains.
Once these have been contacted and re-evaluated to present time realities the mind, as an entity, will be found
to vanish. As the mind contains no postulates that have not been put there by the being during the playing of various
games through time, it is of no value to him, and unless required for reference or aesthetic purposes is best kept
in a state of vanishment.</P>
<P>The being enters games at a desire level; they later become an enforcement, and then an inhibition. Thus, the
being will be found to be in a games condition regarding his past games. As the repository of these old games is
called the mind, the being will be found to he in a games condition with his own mind. As the mind only contains
his own past postulates, he cannot possibly ever win the game against his own mind. It is the one game he can only
lose. Extreme examples of failure in this game we call insanity. What is called the enigma of the mind is the result
of the compulsive games condition that the being is in regarding it. The attitude of the being towards his mind,
or any part of it, can only be one or other of the legs of the goal &#8216;To Know&#8217;. Thus, the mind exhibits the following
phenomena:</P>
<P>Any attempt to create an effect upon it (Must be known) will cause it to resist the effect (Mustn&#8217;t know). The
greater the attempt to create an effect upon it the more resistive it becomes.</P>
<P>Any attempt to withdraw from it (Mustn&#8217;t be known) will cause the mind to seemingly pursue the being (Must know).
Hence, the well known feeling of being &#8216;stuck with&#8217; ones own mind.</P>
<P>Any attempt to know the mind (Must know) will cause the mind to seemingly adopt a &#8216;Mustn&#8217;t be known&#8217; and become
progressively more elusive.</P>
<P>Any attempt to resist the mind (Mustn&#8217;t know) will cause the mind to immediately enforce itself upon the being
(Must be known) and overwhelm him.</P>
<P>It is only this compulsive games condition that a being gets into regarding his own mind, and an ignorance of
its true nature, that has defeated past researchers in this field. It has the well deserved reputation of being
the most difficult subject of all to discover anything about. This compulsive games condition between the being
and his own mind also accounts for the wide-spread apathy we encounter when the subject of doing something about
the mind is mentioned, for most beings have long since fought themselves to a standstill on this subject; they
have become resigned to what they consider the inevitable. Thus, it can be clearly seen that the mind can never
be resolved by going into a games condition with it, for whichever role the being adopts his mind will invariably
overwhelm him.</P>
<P>The key to the resolution of the mind, then, lies in exercising the being in the discovery and creation of complementary
postulates; and, transiently, in unraveling the tangled mass of conflicting postulates that his mind has become.
The mind, being a repository of old games, which are postulates in conflict, has no defense against the application
and re-injection of complementary postulates regarding the effects it contains. In short, we vanish the mind by
progressively getting the being to create, and do exercises in, complementary and conflicting postulates; to create
and experience overt and motivator overwhelms, play games, and generally bring back under his own determinism these
four basic postulates - both as SD and PD - which go to make up the interchange we call life. Enroute he will discover,
or re-discover, all there is to know about life; he will also discover his true nature as a spiritual being.</P>
<P>Knowing the anatomy of games and the Postulate Failure Cycle, it is now possible to list all conceivable classes
of overts and motivators regarding an effect. Its also possible to list them in the order in which they were accumulated
through time. Each leg of the goal &#8216;To Know&#8217; has its own overt and motivator, giving us a total of 8 classes in
all.</P>

<P>If one wished to address these regarding a specific effect on a being one would, of course, work backwards from
8 to 1, as the most recent experiences tend to occlude the earlier ones. Thus, to remove the command power of any
effect from the mind it is only necessary to discharge these various overts and motivators where they appear on
the time track. As can be seen, there are only four classes of overwhelm, and each has a common name in our language:</P>
<P>

</TABLE>
</P>
<P>Infliction/Rejection and Deprivation/Revelation each form a pair, and are associated with one or other of the
two basic games. Viz:</P>
<P>Leg 1 commits the overt of Infliction, and suffers the motivator of rejection. Leg 2) commits the overt of Deprivation,
and suffers the motivator of Revelation. Leg 3) commits the overt of Revelation, and suffers the motivator of Deprivation.
Leg 4) commits the overt of Rejection, and suffers the motivator of Infliction.</P>
<P>( <U>Important</U> <U>note.</U> It must be realized that these 4 words are only substitutes for the exact postulates
as given in the Postulate Failure Cycle chart, and should only be used with that in mind. Thus, they may prove
useful early on, but later the exact postulates as given on the chart must be used if you ever wish to take the
mind apart cleanly. )</P>
<P>People do tend - repeat <U>tend</U> - to become more or less fixed in one or other of the legs of the basic
game, and take on the personality characteristics of the postulate they are dramatizing. Viz:</P>
<P><U>Must be known</U>. Outflowing. Extrovert. Persuasive. Creative. Often prone to jealousy. Overts by infliction,
and very upset by rejection. He got into this leg by being overwhelmed by a Must Be Known, whose valence he now
occupies.</P>
<P><U>Mustn&#8217;t be known</U>. Restrained outflow. Retiring. Devious. Secretive. Obsessed by &#8216;privacy&#8217;. Tends to collect
mass and wealth by the simple expedient of not being able to outflow it. Overts by deprivation, and very worried
by the thought of their secret wheeler-dealings being revealed. He got into this leg by being overwhelmed by a
Mustn&#8217;t know while being in the Must be known leg; he now dramatizes the Mustn&#8217;t be known PD postulate of his overwhelmer.</P>
<P><U>Must know.</U> Inflow. Nosey. Curious. Inclined to he highly sensual. Demands open comm lines. Hates secrets,
and loves exposing them. Good solver of puzzles. Overts by revelation, and just hates being deprived of things.
He got into this leg by being overwhelmed by a Must know, whose valence he now occupies.</P>
<P><U>Mustn&#8217;t know.</U> Restrained inflow. Rejection. Compulsively makes nothing out of things. Destructive. Overts
by rejection, and dreads having anything inflicted upon him. Contrary to popular opinion he did not get this way
by having things forced upon him. He got into this leg by being overwhelmed by a Mustn&#8217;t be known while being in
the Must know leg; he now dramatizes the Mustn&#8217;t know PD postulate of his overwhelmer. He&#8217;s been overwhelmed by
deprivation.</P>
<P>Most people are a composite of the above types, but you will come across an almost &#8216;pure&#8217; type occasionally.
Generally speaking, the more inflexible the personality, the more it will tend towards a &#8216;pure&#8217; type. It can also
be seen that the class of motivators the being complains of not only tells you the type of overts he compulsively
commits, the leg of the basic game he is dramatizing, but also just how he got into that leg. Thus, the data is
of inestimable value when dealing with the mind.</P>
<P>The entire secret of making any mental mass vanish is to re-evaluate its importance to present time realities
to the point where it is considered so trivial that there is no longer any need to keep it in existence; at which
moment the mass can be easily not-known and will promptly vanish. While the mass is considered important it will
continue in existence, and the being will continue to know it - even though trying desperately to not-know it.
To try and vanish by means of force a mass while still holding the consideration that it is important is thus the
height of stupidity, and can only lead to frustration and failure. Thus we see that the re-evaluation of past importances
is the <U>only</U> step required to achieve the vanishment of any mental mass. As a successful psychotherapy can
be defined as a system that brings about the vanishment of unwanted mental conditions, we see that this data is
vital to our goal.</P>
<P>The ability to assign and unassign importances, while native to the being, will be found to require some attention
on the route out.</P>
<P>The assignment of the consideration of unimportance to a mental mass after having considered the mass important
is merely an attempt to devalue it (Mustn&#8217;t know), and is just another method of attempting to vanish it by means
of force. Hence, we have no need to consider the subject of unimportance. Once one grasps that the need to regard
a thing as unimportant is an importance in its own right, one has entirely got the flavor of all this. The &#8216;button&#8217;
is importance; the unimportance comes out in the wash.</P>
<P>The being, in his progressively more and more violent games condition with his own mind has endeavored to devalue
it in the hope that it will go away and leave him alone. The cycle has been:</P>
<P>Mind considered as a series of past scenes.<BR>
Mind considered as pictures of past scenes.<BR>
Mind considered as memories, having no objection existence.<BR>
Mind considered as configurations in the brain.</P>
<P>The truth is that we have a being who can look at scenes. He can look at &#8216;now&#8217; scenes, and he can look at &#8216;then&#8217;
scenes. The only difference is that &#8216;then&#8217; scenes are scenes of &#8216;then&#8217; and &#8216;now&#8217; scenes are scenes of &#8216;now&#8217;. If
&#8216;then&#8217; seems less real than &#8216;now&#8217;, it is only because the being has made it so. A being can only communicate across
a distance. He cannot communicate through time. So when he is looking at a &#8216;then&#8217; he is looking at it now. Whatever
he looks at, he looks at now.</P>
<P>A being can view &#8216;now&#8217; from any viewpoint. A being can view &#8216;then&#8217; from any viewpoint. Thus, every moment in
time is a complete universe which is viewable to the being. (Viewpoint here is used in the sense of a &#8216;position
from which to view&#8217;, and not in the sense of holding a mental opinion.) Thus, a being is natively capable of viewing
every particle that has ever been brought into existence in this, or any other universe, from any viewpoint he
so desire. He is also natively capable of taking any of these particle back out of existence again if he so desires.
Whether or not he can get agreement from others on this latter step is merely a matter of how convincing he is
to others, and is not a pre-requisite to the accomplishment of the feat. That others may choose to keep these particles
in existence, still is, in the final instance, entirely their concern. Thus, you can walk out of the trap without
the need to take everyone else with you. Believing differently is not to grant others the right to their own convictions
- a trap all of its own.</P>
<P>Any changes you bring about, whether changes in &#8216;then&#8217; or changes in &#8216;now&#8217; you bring about now. So any changes
yoummake to &#8216;then&#8217;, later than when the event occured, wil not ipso-facto produce changes in &#8216;now&#8217;. Thus, what
is called the time paradox is exposed for the lie that it is.</P>
<P>If this concept seems difficult to grasp, it is only because on has become used to the idea of moving through
time. This is an illusion brought about be entrapment in mass which is enduring through time. Only the particles,
the effects, are created, made to endure, and are finally destroyed. The spiritual being, the creator of all these
postulates, is utterly timeless. Once one fully grasps this, it is easy to see that changing the past does not
ipso-facto produce a change in the present.</P>
<P>The Law of Duality. This states that the assignment of importance to a thing, or class of things, automatically
assigns importance to the opposite or absence of those things. Thus, if life is considered important, then death
- the absence of life - has also been granted importance. If the concept of &#8216;self&#8217; is considered important, then
the concept of &#8216;not-self&#8217; is thereby also granted importance. From this law we see the proliferation and self-perpetuating
nature of games.</P>
<P>The evaluation of things, one against the other, is achieved by the noting of differences and similarities between
them. The ease of evaluation is inversely proportional to the considered spatial and/or temporal separation of
the things being compared. Thus, evaluation is easiest when the two things are placed side by side in the same
moment of time. The limit is reached when the two things are viewed simultaneously, for then no time elapses while
the attention shifts from one to the other.</P>
<P>Thus, a &#8216;then&#8217; importance and a &#8216;now&#8217; importance are best evaluated when viewed simultaneously in the same moment
of time - now.</P>
<P>The general action of simultaneously viewing a &#8216;then&#8217; and a &#8216;now&#8217; scene is called Timebreaking. The name derives
from the fact that the action of Timebreaking breaks the temporal separation of &#8216;then&#8217; and &#8216;now&#8217;, and thus removes
the command power of the past scene so Timebroken.</P>
<P>That which has been Timebroken no longer has a command power over the being. The ability to Timebreak is native
to the being, but due to the compulsive games condition the being is in regarding his past the ability has been
to a greater or lesser degree lost, and for many will have to be learned again almost from scratch. There are exercises
to improve the ability.</P>
<P>Timebreaking is the basis of all psychotherapy. When the patient tells his therapist of some past happening
he is Timebreaking the happening, for the therapist and the incident are thus brought into the same moment in time
- now.</P>
<P>However, a being can learn to Timebreak solo, and thus dispense with the need for a separate therapist. The
mechanism is in no way dependent upon the presence of another person. As he becomes more and more proficient in
the skill the being soon reaches a stage where the presence of a separate therapist is not only unnecessary, but
is actually slowing down the patient&#8217;s progress; he can Timebreak much, much faster than any separate therapist
could conceivably follow, and the continual need to keep reporting progress to the therapist becomes increasingly
inhibitive of gains.</P>
<P>Mankind has always known that telling his troubles to another was helpful, but has attributed it to some quality
in the other person, or to the fact that he is talking to him. But this is not so. The benefit was always derived
from the mechanics of Timebreaking: the simultaneous communication with &#8216;then&#8217; and &#8216;now&#8217;. Now the true facts are
known, a separate therapist is only required until such time as the patient is confident that they can do the job
alone. From the viewpoint of the therapist its a matter of helping another until such time as they are capable
of helping themselves, and all assistance should be given with this view in mind. Any other approach, although
undoubtedly good for business, is just not in the best interest of the patient.</P>
<P>The mind is like an itch. Although early on the being might require a separate therapist to scratch it for him,
he must be encouraged to do his own scratching, or he&#8217;ll be needing a therapist to scratch his itch forever. Dependence
upon the therapist must never be permitted to build up, and at all times the patient should be encouraged to stand
on his own feet. Its his mind. He created it; he is maintaining it, and in the final instance only he can vanish
it.</P>
<P>The intensity of the compulsive games condition between a being and his past is the sole factor that determines
whether he can walk out of the trap unaided, or will, in the early stages, require assistance from a separate therapist.
There is, in fact, a test which readily determines whether a being can go solo from the word go, or will need assistance
early on from a separate therapist.</P>
<P>Due to the nature of the compulsive games conditions between a being and his past, the more he is willing to
Timebreak it the less he has to Timebreak. Very soon he is left with nothing to Timebreak, and has to actively
stimulate the past if he wishes to continue the exercise. He soon goes from the cringing victim, afraid to &#8216;tamper&#8217;
with his mind, to the triumphant victor pursuing the remnants wherever he can find them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="life"></A><U>Life and Life forms.</U></P>
<P>Life is undoubtedly the most abundant phenomena on the surface of this planet, as it is in the entire universe.
Only the most superficial glance through a microscope at a drop of pond water, coupled with the realization that
every cell in the body is alive in its own right, is sufficient to convince all but the invincibly ignorant of
the fact. A life form is an aggregation of cellular life organized and directed by &#8216;higher&#8217; life in a hierarchy
that leads up to the being who answers up when his name is called. He is the one who does the exercises.</P>
<P>The human body is thus a life form and a complex cellular structure. It is also a mammal, and a member of what
is called the higher ape family. A knowledge of the eating, mating cultural and social habits of this ape are invaluable
to any being who wishes to walk this route. Know this ape whose body you currently consider yourself a part of,
for such knowledge will bear you in good stead. Many a person has spent half their lives at war with one or other
of this ape&#8217;s inherited social or cultural habits, and have at last gone to their graves defeated in the struggle.
When you try and fight this ape&#8217;s evolutionary history you always lose. He has certain basic requirements, and
a number of quaint behavior patterns. Learn to live with them, for you will not change him by fighting them; you&#8217;ll
only make him ill and yourself miserable. Ignorance of the true nature of the human ape as a life form has caused
untold misery down the ages. If you walk this route far enough you will one day walk away and leave this ape, but
you will never be free of him until you understand him intimately.</P>
