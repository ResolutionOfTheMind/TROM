					<TD WIDTH="100%">&quot;It is not necessary to believe the theory before the practical exercises will work for you; just hold it
						as a possibility, that is all. Even the fact that the practical works doesn�t make the theory right, for there�s
						a number of possible theories from which the practical could be derived. However, until such time as practical
						derived from theory is found not to work it is safe to regard the theory as useful. No more can be said of any
						theory. Also, it's rightness or wrongness depends on how well it explains natural law, not what people think about
						it.<BR>
						<BR>
						I know of no applications where this theory falls short of explaining observed phenomena. However, I�ll be the
						first to applaud any being who can explain all the facts with a simpler theory from which even more workable practical
						exercises can be derived. (Occam was an old friend of mine.)&quot;</TD>
